Provides an Opt-Out functionality for Google Analytics

== Description ==

This plugin provides an Opt-Out functionality for Google Analytics by setting a cookie that prevents analytics.js or gtag.js to collect data. The new GDPR rules requires an opt-out.

Works perfectly together with the [Google Analytics by MonsterInsights Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/ "Google Analytics by MonsterInsights Plugin"). However the plugin is not necessary to configure the opt-out feature. Just enter your UA- or GA-Code manually. That's it!

The free and the pro version have now been merged together. So you now can have the option to activate a banner, too! Enjoy!

== Installation ==

* Install and activate the plugin via your WordPress Administration panel
* Go the "Settings" -> "Analytics Opt Out" and enter your UA- or GA-code (you don't need this step if MonsterInsights plugin is active).
* [Read the FAQ for more information.](https://wp-buddy.com/documentation/plugins/google-analytics-opt/faq/)

4. This is the settings page
